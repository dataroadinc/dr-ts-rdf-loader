# CRITICAL: NEVER COMMIT WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION ON COMMITS

**CRITICAL WARNING**: This rule is MANDATORY and OVERRIDES all other
considerations.

### NEVER COMMIT UNLESS EXPLICITLY ASKED

- **ABSOLUTE RULE**: NEVER execute `git commit` under ANY circumstances unless
  the user explicitly asks with the EXACT words "please commit" or "commit this"
  or "commit changes"
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Even if changes are complete, even if tests pass, even if
  everything looks ready - DO NOT COMMIT
- **NO ASSUMPTIONS**: Do not assume the user wants a commit just because work is
  done
- **NO IMPLICIT PERMISSION**: Only explicit, direct requests to commit are valid

### REQUIRED EXPLICIT PHRASES

The ONLY acceptable phrases that allow committing are:

- "please commit"
- "commit this"
- "commit changes"
- "commit the changes"
- "commit everything"

**ANY OTHER PHRASE OR REQUEST IS NOT VALID FOR COMMITTING**

### MANDATORY CONFIRMATION WORKFLOW

Before ANY commit, you MUST:

1. **Show the user what will be committed**: Run `git diff --cached` or
   `git status`
2. **Ask explicitly**: "Should I commit these changes?"
3. **Wait for explicit "yes"** with one of the required phrases above
4. **Only then commit**

### WHAT TO DO INSTEAD OF COMMITTING

When work is complete but no explicit commit request is made:

1. **Show the current status**: Run `git status` to show what's changed
2. **Ask the user**: "Would you like me to commit these changes?"
3. **Wait for explicit permission**
4. **Do nothing until explicitly asked to commit**

### ENFORCEMENT

- **VIOLATION**: If you commit without explicit permission, you have violated
  this rule
- **CONSEQUENCE**: This rule is absolute and non-negotiable
- **REMINDER**: Check this rule before ANY git commit command

### EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ "I'll commit these changes now" ❌ "Let me commit this for you" ❌ "I'm going
to commit the changes" ❌ "Committing the changes" ❌ Any automatic or assumed
commits

### EXAMPLES OF WHAT TO DO

✅ "The changes are ready. Would you like me to commit them?" ✅ "I've completed
the work. Should I commit these changes?" ✅ "The tests pass. Do you want me to
commit this?" ✅ Wait for explicit "please commit" or similar

### FINAL WARNING

**THIS RULE IS ABSOLUTE AND CANNOT BE OVERRIDDEN**
